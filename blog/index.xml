I would like to create something new every day. I would like to take a picture, tell a story, share an idea, or illustrate something.
I would like to say a kind word, hold my wife&amp;rsquo;s hand, hug my children, tell them I love them.
I would like eat something tasty, walk a few miles, listen to music.
I would like to make a wish, say a prayer, think kind thoughts for others.</description></item><item><title>Reflecting on the Why (of this Site)</title><link>https://law.aritao.dev/blog/four/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Apr 2021 21:31:45 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://law.aritao.dev/blog/four/</guid><description>by Law Aritao
Reflections on Why I want to explore why I am doing this blog and why I consider Hugo and Github pages a great choice.
Why Hugo and Github Pages? In the past twelve months, I explored Wordpress, Ghost, Wix, Wordpress/Ghost on various platforms: Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Azure, Linode, Digital Ocean, and Vultr.

It&amp;rsquo;s gotten so bad that I now have several Markdown editors on my devices, and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mind more. I use Caret, Inkdrop, Nota, and SimpleNote. Caret is nice because it is available on both Windows and MacOs, and it is gorgeous.</description></item><item><title>A Learning Adventure - Part Two</title><link>https://law.aritao.dev/blog/two/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Apr 2021 07:23:26 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://law.aritao.dev/blog/two/</guid><description>by Law Aritao

Deeper Down the Rabbit Hole As I worked on site content and structure, I switched to this theme for its design and overall quality. Reading the theme&amp;rsquo;s documentation gave me some additional lessons in the way Hugo creates the static output (Hugo&amp;rsquo;s lookup order). The relatively painless switch in themes gave me a greater appreciation for Hugo&amp;rsquo;s design.</description></item><item><title>A Learning Adventure via Github + Hugo</title><link>https://law.aritao.dev/blog/one/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 07:23:26 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://law.aritao.dev/blog/one/</guid><description>by Law Aritao

Down the Rabbit Hole I recently figured out how to use Github pages to host a Hugo-created blog site (got interested because of this. As I was learning the method, I got hooked on the beauty of Github. After tinkering and understanding Github a little bit more, I have fallen in love with it.</description></item></channel></rss>
