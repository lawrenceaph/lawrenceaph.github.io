[{"title":"CloudFlare Pages: Deploy Awesome Static Sites, Quickly.","date":"","description":"","body":"Cloudflare Pages. Another awesome way to deploy a site. I was pleasantly surprised to see how user-friendly Cloudflare Pages is. As someone doing coding and development as a new hobby, it\u0026rsquo;s refreshing to use intuitive tools and an uncluttered interface.\nThe steps I followed to deploy were:\n Create a repository on github.com. Create the Hugo site locally Initialize a git repository in the local Hugo site work directory, and commit it to the remote repository, main branch. Create a Project on Cloudflare Pages and grant authority to Pages using your Github.com account. Choose the repository, supply build command, and any variables.  That was it. I\u0026rsquo;ve been using this solution to host my coffee site, whose perfromance has greatly improved since the switch.\nYou can learn more about Pages on pages.dev.\n","ref":"/blog/seven/"},{"title":"Little Things Make Me Happy","date":"","description":"","body":"Typography, for instance  Typography is the visual component of the written word.\n-Matthew Butterick\n It feels so good to read text visualized and displayed through good typography.\nBooks, magazines, websites, apps, user interfaces come alive with the right typefaces. I find Butterick\u0026rsquo;s Practical Typography and Typography for Lawyers very helpful.\nI have three guidelines when choosing typefaces / fonts for my work:\n They should be easy to read on screen and on paper. They should fit the project\u0026rsquo;s purpose and aesthetic. I should enjoy looking at the text displayed through the font.  Analog roots I also like how some of the vocabulary for typography comes from the days of the printing press. For instance:\nLeading - distance between lines of text. Typesetters once relied on lead strips to maintain even spacing between lines. It\u0026rsquo;s nice how the term points to the history of type.\nKerning - the horizontal space between characters. Kern used to refer to the portion of metal type that hung over a metal character block (see image below). With a portion hanging over the block, the printed character would be closer to next one. Kern now refers to the actual spacing between characters.\nAttribution: Metal_type.svg: User:Booyabazooka, User:Jenson derivative work: Rick Yorgason, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\nDo you enjoy typography?

In the past twelve months, I explored Wordpress, Ghost, Wix, Wordpress/Ghost on various platforms: Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Azure, Linode, Digital Ocean, and Vultr. I also tried creating a static site and hosting it on Amazon Amplify.\nI sampled these solutions and combinations haphazardly - the way you might look through a pile of books and read a few pages until a particular narrative just calls out to you. In hindsight, I was looking for a tool I felt a connection to.\nWordpress, A Behemoth that I Like But Don\u0026rsquo;t Want to Use Wordpress was a strange thing to use. Its default theme started out blazing fast, and everything felt snappy until I customized it. In fairness to Wordpress, I was part of the problem. I will use a plugin for everything, just because. At one point, I had an LMS plugin, membership plugin, PWA plugin, site building plugin, flipbook plugin, among others. I spent so much time customizing the site that I had little time to create content\nGhost- a lean machine that holds itâ€™s own. Seriously beautiful. Ghost was the opposite of Wordpress for me - there was no need for plugins. It had everything built in, almost. It supported Mardown and HTML in a post. Wow. For features I wanted, like using code for a Progressive Web App, I could tweak the theme, add a few files, do a code injection, and the work was done. Nice.\nAfter learning Ghost, I concluded it would be great for some of my writing pursuits, but I still felt like exploring other ways to publish. For that, I looked to the cloud(s).\nCloud Platforms - A Wonderful Place to Get Lost In I am a Gigantic Fan of cloud services like GCP, AWS, Azure, and Vultr. They had an incredible array of options and in the end were overpowered for a personal blog or site. They are great for business, or for tinkering and learning. My cloud journey did lead to a project using Wordpress as a containerized solution. That\u0026rsquo;s a fun thing I\u0026rsquo;m still working on.\nHugo and Github Pages - Flexible, Fun, Life-giving When I discovered Hugo and Github Pages, I found something truly special. I know Hugo is not the only static site generator, and I know there are many other ways to host content.\nThe differentiating factor for me was the blend of flexibility, aesthetics, and scrappiness I felt from the Hugo + Github Pages combination. Hugo is highly customizable, but it also allows me to fire up a themed site quickly. It has nice documentation on an accessible site. And, it\u0026rsquo;s fast. Blazing fast. Plus, it uses Markdown. Beautiful, wonderful, Markdown.\nGithub Pages - a window into a community. I\u0026rsquo;m just getting started with Github and Github pages, but I already love the platform, and I love that Github Actions allows us to push new content out through a simple workflow. Github might be a giant community, but it somehow feels small at the same time. This makes me happy about using it.\nThe other, deeper why. For the actual why behind this blog, it is that creating content, especially through writing and publishing, is one of the most life-giving activities I can do. It is a comfort in the middle of this harsh and devastating pandemic. I am glad I can do that on a platform built on the ideas of shared work and mutual support.\nCheers, and see you on the next post.\n","ref":"/blog/four/"},{"title":"Beautiful Markdown","date":"","description":"","body":"by Law Aritao\nBeautiful Markdown Hugo, my preferred site generator, supports Markdown, a beautiful markup language that\u0026rsquo;s been around since 2004. I love Markdown. It is simple. It is beautiful. It is intuitive (once you get the hang of some fundamentals).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s gotten so bad that I now have several Markdown editors on my devices, and I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t mind more. I use Caret, Inkdrop, Nota, and SimpleNote. Caret is nice because it is available on both Windows and MacOs, and it is gorgeous. Just look at its beautiful preview mode:\nMarkdown Resources Two resources that really helped me get some footing in Markdown were by Matt Cone. I started by reading his book, and in the beginning I would constantly check his site, the Markdown Guide, as a quick reference. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend, the Markdown Guide (site) is a sufficient resource. I acquired the book as a way to thank Matt for the great work he\u0026rsquo;s been doing. It\u0026rsquo;s well written and a quick read, too. Lots of value.\nQuick Credit to Markdown\u0026rsquo;s Creators Markdown originated in 2004 from the efforts of John Gruber and Aaron Swartz. I wanted to mention them, as they created something quite breathtaking, and they deserve credit for it.\nMany Flavors and Much to Learn There are a lot of Markdown flavors and extended syntax, for advanced features. I\u0026rsquo;m still learning these, but as with many things, you only need to know a few basic things about Markdown to start enjoying it.\nDo you use Markdown? What\u0026rsquo;s your favorite editor?\nFurther Reading I really liked this essay on Markdown. Do have a look.

So much fun.\nPhoto credit: Thomas Willmott on unsplash.\nDeeper Down the Rabbit Hole As I worked on site content and structure, I switched to this theme for its design and overall quality. Reading the theme\u0026rsquo;s documentation gave me some additional lessons in the way Hugo creates the static output (Hugo\u0026rsquo;s lookup order). The relatively painless switch in themes gave me a greater appreciation for Hugo\u0026rsquo;s design. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s simple, precise behaviors allowed me to more comfortably predict the effects of my actions. The lookup order can be found in Hugo\u0026rsquo;s official documentation.\nComments with Hyvor Talk - Static Man next! I\u0026rsquo;ve been using HyvorTalk for comments and reactions, as it was something I used in other projects. The documentation for hugo-future-imperfect-slim had a paragraph on staticman, an open-source comment solution for static sites. I hope to test the feature soon, as it looks quite promising. The sample site has a few posts that you can check to see how the staticman comment solutions looks on a page. It is quite beautiful. Do you use Staticman? Let me know in the comments. Maybe I can learn from you!

With Github, I found the next best thing.\nPhoto credit: Dmitry Ratushny on unsplash\nDown the Rabbit Hole I recently figured out how to use Github pages to host a Hugo-created blog site (got interested because of this. As I was learning the method, I got hooked on the beauty of Github. After tinkering and understanding Github a little bit more, I have fallen in love with it.\nIncremental Learning Github\u0026rsquo;s knowledge management features are a wonderful support to the incremental, learning-by-doing style I naturally gravitate to. This blog is one such learning project, and I hope to conduct many experiments here and in other places. Check back soon for more content. If you are doing something similar, let me know in the comments below. Cheers!\nUpdate - had issues with subdomain - fixed I forgot that I commented out/deactivated the line in the yml file that specified my subdomain, which resulted in the constant removing of the subdomain from the pages configuration during updates to the public repository. That has now been fixed. Yay. And, lesson learned.\n","ref":"/blog/one/"}]
