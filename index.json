[{"title":"Beautiful Markdown","date":"","description":"","body":"Beautiful Markdown An upside to learning how to use the static site generator Hugo is that I\u0026rsquo;m also able to develop fluency in Markdown, the beautiful markup language Hugo uses for its content posts. I love Markdown. It is simple. It is beautiful. It is intuitive (once you get the hang of some fundamentals).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s gotten so bad that I now have several Markdown editors on my devices, and I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t mind more. I use Caret, Inkdrop, Nota, and SimpleNote. Caret is nice because it is available on both Windows and MacOs, and it is gorgeous. Just look at its beautiful preview mode:\nMarkdown Resources Two resources that really helped me get some footing in Markdown were by Matt Cone. I started by reading his book, and in the beginning I would constantly check his site, the Markdown Guide, as a quick reference. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend, the Markdown Guide (site) is a sufficient resource. I acquired the book as a way to thank Matt for the great work he\u0026rsquo;s been doing. It\u0026rsquo;s well written and a quick read, too. Lots of value.\nQuick Credit to Markdown\u0026rsquo;s Creators Markdown originated in 2004 from the efforts of John Gruber and Aaron Swartz. I wanted tomentioned them, as they created something quite breathtaking, and they deserve credit for it.\nMany Flavors and Much to Learn There are a lot of Markdown flavors and extended syntax, for advanced features. I\u0026rsquo;m still learning these, but as with many things, you only need to know a few basic things about Markdown to start enjoying it.\nDo you use Markdown? What\u0026rsquo;s your favorite editor?\nFurther Reading I really liked this essay on Markdown. Do have a look. See you on the next post!\n","ref":"/blog/three/"},{"title":"Contact","date":"","description":"","body":"Reach out IG: coffeeandthis\nTwitter: law_aritao\nGithub: lawrenceaph\n","ref":"/contact/"},{"title":"About","date":"","description":"","body":"Adventures in Learning ","ref":"/about/"},{"title":"A Learning Adventure - Part Two","date":"","description":"","body":"I walk farther down the path of Hugo and Github Pages. So much fun.\nPhoto credit: Thomas Willmott on unsplash.\nDeeper Down the Rabbit Hole As I worked on site content and structure, I switched to this theme for its design and overall quality. Reading the theme\u0026rsquo;s documentation gave me some additional lessons in the way Hugo creates the static output (Hugo\u0026rsquo;s lookup order). The relatively painless switch in themes gave me a greater appreciation for Hugo\u0026rsquo;s design. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s simple, precise behaviors allowed me to more comfortably predict the effects of my actions. The lookup order can be found in Hugo\u0026rsquo;s official documentation.\nComments with Hyvor Talk - Static Man next! I\u0026rsquo;ve been using HyvorTalk for comments and reactions, as it was something I used in other projects. The documentation for hugo-future-imperfect-slim had a paragraph on staticman, an open-source comment solution for static sites. I hope to test the feature soon, as it looks quite promising. The sample site has a few posts that you can check to see how the staticman comment solutions looks on a page. It is quite beautiful. Do you use Staticman? Let me know in the comments. Maybe I can learn from you! Cheers.\n","ref":"/blog/two/"},{"title":"A Learning Adventure via Github + Hugo","date":"","description":"","body":"Wonderful Github Somtimes I wish I could just learn by osmosis. With Github, I found the next best thing.\nPhoto credit: Dmitry Ratushny on unsplash\nDown the Rabbit Hole I recently figured out how to use Github pages to host a Hugo-created blog site (got interested because of this. As I was learning the method, I got hooked on the beauty of Github. After tinkering and understanding Github a little bit more, I have fallen in love with it.\nIncremental Learning Github\u0026rsquo;s knowledge management features are a wonderful support to the incremental, learning-by-doing style I naturally gravitate to. This blog is one such learning project, and I hope to conduct many experiments here and in other places. Check back soon for more content. If you are doing something similar, let me know in the comments below. Cheers!\nUpdate - had issues with subdomain - fixed I forgot that I commented out/deactivated the line in the yml file that specified my subdomain, which resulted in the constant removing of the subdomain from the pages configuration during updates to the public repository. That has now been fixed. Yay. And, lesson learned.\n","ref":"/blog/one/"}]
