[{"title":"Reflecting on the Why (of this Site)","date":"","description":"","body":"by Law Aritao\nReflections on Why I want to explore why I am doing this blog and why I consider Hugo and Github pages ideal. I would like to stop and think about that, because I explored numerous self-publishing tools, but didn\u0026rsquo;t feel content unti I discovered Github pages and Hugo. What was it about the Hugo and Github Pages combination that caused me to stop searching for a platform and start generating content steadily?\nWhy Hugo and Github Pages? In the past twelve months, I explored Wordpress, Ghost, Wix, Wordpress/Ghost on various platforms: Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Azure, Linode, Digital Ocean, and Vultr. I also tried creating a static site and hosting it on Amazon Amplify.\nI sampled these solutions and combinations haphazardly - the way you might look through a pile of books and read a few pages until a particular narrative just calls out to you. In hindsight, I was looking for a tool I felt a connection to, something with a story that I wanted to be part of.\nWordpress, A Behemoth that I Like But Don\u0026rsquo;t Want to Use Wordpress was a strange thing to use. Its default theme starts out blazing fast, and everything is snappy right up until you start customizing it to look and feel the way you want it to. I am one of those who will use a plugin for everything that comes to mind (eventually, I had an LMS, membership plugin, PWA plugin, site building plugin, flipbook plugin, and many more). I spent so much time customizing the look and feel of the site that I had nearly zero time left to author content. So, Wordpress was a non-starter. The breadth of choices paralyzed me.\nGhost- a lean machine that holds it’s own. Seriously beautiful. Ghost was the opposite of Wordpress for me - there was no need for plugins. It had everything built in, almost. It supported Mardown and HTML in a post. Wow. For features I wanted, like using code for a Progressive Web App, I could tweak the theme to add the manifest and a service worker, do a code injection, and the work was done. Nice.\nAfter learning Ghost, I concluded it would be great for some of my writing pursuits but, I still felt like my search for a platform I truly connected with was not over. My search took me deeper into the cloud(s).\nCloud Platforms - A Wonderful Place to Get Lost In I am a Gigantic Fan of cloud services like GCP, AWS, Azure, and Vultr. I am enamored by the idea of using powerful cloud resources to create solutions, build spaces for ideas and shared knowledge. I understand that the best use cases are probably for enterprises, but the fact that I can use these incredible technologies for any project I want is just pure fun. Still, for blogging personal content, I felt those platforms did not have the connection I wanted. I might use them for business, or for tinkering and learning. For example, I have a project testing Wordpress as a cotainerized solution via Cloud Run. However, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t use GCP, AWS, or Azure to document my personal exploration of coding and development. For that, I’ve chosen Hugo and GitHub Pages.\nHugo and Github Pages - Flexible, Fun, Life-giving When I discovered Hugo and Github Pages, I found something truly special. I know that Hugo is not the only static site generator worth using. There\u0026rsquo;s Jekyll, for instance. And of course, the option of just making a site from scratch with cool editors like Atom or VSCode, or using Dreamweaver and Boostrap to generate something semi-customized. That was all on the table when I found Hugo. The differentiating factor was balance.\nHugo is highly customizable, but it also allows me to fire up a themed site quickly. Hugo offers clear, intuitive rules documented in an accessible site. And, it\u0026rsquo;s fast. Blazing fast. Plus, it uses Markdown. Beautiful, wonderful, Markdown. The balance of flexibility, speed, and beauty, is what got me hooked on Hugo.\nGithub Pages - a window into a community. I\u0026rsquo;m just getting started with Github and Github pages, but I already love the platform, and I love that Github Actions allows us to push new content out through a simple workflow.\nGithub as a community is also what really makes me happy about using its features. There is so much collaboration and mutual support happening on the platform. It\u0026rsquo;s hard not to want to just be in it, as a fly on the wall, or a happy learner.\nThe other, deeper why. For the actual why behind this blog, it is that creating content, especially through writing and publishing, is for me one of the most life-giving activities I can do. It is a comfort in the middle of this harsh and devastatang pandemic. I am glad I can do that on a platform with a story I can be part of.\nCheers, and see you on the next post.\n","ref":"/blog/four/"},{"title":"Beautiful Markdown","date":"","description":"","body":"by Law Aritao\nBeautiful Markdown An upside to learning how to use the static site generator Hugo is that I\u0026rsquo;m also able to develop fluency in Markdown, the beautiful markup language Hugo uses for its content posts. I love Markdown. It is simple. It is beautiful. It is intuitive (once you get the hang of some fundamentals).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s gotten so bad that I now have several Markdown editors on my devices, and I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t mind more. I use Caret, Inkdrop, Nota, and SimpleNote. Caret is nice because it is available on both Windows and MacOs, and it is gorgeous. Just look at its beautiful preview mode:\nMarkdown Resources Two resources that really helped me get some footing in Markdown were by Matt Cone. I started by reading his book, and in the beginning I would constantly check his site, the Markdown Guide, as a quick reference. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend, the Markdown Guide (site) is a sufficient resource. I acquired the book as a way to thank Matt for the great work he\u0026rsquo;s been doing. It\u0026rsquo;s well written and a quick read, too. Lots of value.\nQuick Credit to Markdown\u0026rsquo;s Creators Markdown originated in 2004 from the efforts of John Gruber and Aaron Swartz. I wanted to mention them, as they created something quite breathtaking, and they deserve credit for it.\nMany Flavors and Much to Learn There are a lot of Markdown flavors and extended syntax, for advanced features. I\u0026rsquo;m still learning these, but as with many things, you only need to know a few basic things about Markdown to start enjoying it.\nDo you use Markdown? What\u0026rsquo;s your favorite editor?\nFurther Reading I really liked this essay on Markdown. Do have a look. See you on the next post!\n","ref":"/blog/three/"},{"title":"Contact","date":"","description":"","body":"Reach out IG: coffeeandthis\nTwitter: law_aritao\nGithub: lawrenceaph\n","ref":"/contact/"},{"title":"About","date":"","description":"","body":"Adventures in Learning ","ref":"/about/"},{"title":"A Learning Adventure - Part Two","date":"","description":"","body":"by Law Aritao\nI walk farther down the path of Hugo and Github Pages. So much fun.\nPhoto credit: Thomas Willmott on unsplash.\nDeeper Down the Rabbit Hole As I worked on site content and structure, I switched to this theme for its design and overall quality. Reading the theme\u0026rsquo;s documentation gave me some additional lessons in the way Hugo creates the static output (Hugo\u0026rsquo;s lookup order). The relatively painless switch in themes gave me a greater appreciation for Hugo\u0026rsquo;s design. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s simple, precise behaviors allowed me to more comfortably predict the effects of my actions. The lookup order can be found in Hugo\u0026rsquo;s official documentation.\nComments with Hyvor Talk - Static Man next! I\u0026rsquo;ve been using HyvorTalk for comments and reactions, as it was something I used in other projects. The documentation for hugo-future-imperfect-slim had a paragraph on staticman, an open-source comment solution for static sites. I hope to test the feature soon, as it looks quite promising. The sample site has a few posts that you can check to see how the staticman comment solutions looks on a page. It is quite beautiful. Do you use Staticman? Let me know in the comments. Maybe I can learn from you! Cheers.\n","ref":"/blog/two/"},{"title":"A Learning Adventure via Github + Hugo","date":"","description":"","body":"by Law Aritao\nWonderful Github Somtimes I wish I could just learn by osmosis. With Github, I found the next best thing.\nPhoto credit: Dmitry Ratushny on unsplash\nDown the Rabbit Hole I recently figured out how to use Github pages to host a Hugo-created blog site (got interested because of this. As I was learning the method, I got hooked on the beauty of Github. After tinkering and understanding Github a little bit more, I have fallen in love with it.\nIncremental Learning Github\u0026rsquo;s knowledge management features are a wonderful support to the incremental, learning-by-doing style I naturally gravitate to. This blog is one such learning project, and I hope to conduct many experiments here and in other places. Check back soon for more content. If you are doing something similar, let me know in the comments below. Cheers!\nUpdate - had issues with subdomain - fixed I forgot that I commented out/deactivated the line in the yml file that specified my subdomain, which resulted in the constant removing of the subdomain from the pages configuration during updates to the public repository. That has now been fixed. Yay. And, lesson learned.\n","ref":"/blog/one/"}]
