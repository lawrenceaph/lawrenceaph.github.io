With Github, I found the next best thing.\nDown the Rabbit Hole I recently figured out how to use Github pages to host a Hugo-created blog site (got interested because of this. As I was learning the method, I got hooked on the beauty of Github. After tinkering and understanding Github a little bit more, I have fallen in love with it.\nIncremental Learning Github\u0026rsquo;s knowledge management features are a wonderful support to the incremental, learning-by-doing style I naturally gravitate to. This blog is one such learning project, and I hope to conduct many experiments here and in other places. Check back soon for more content. If you are doing something similar, let me know in the comments below. Cheers!\nUpdate - had issues with subdomain - fixed I forgot that I commented out/deactivated the line in the yml file that specified my subdomain, which resulted in the constant removing of the subdomain from the pages configuration during updates to the public repository. That has now been fixed. Yay. And, lesson learned.\n","ref":"/blog/one/"}]
