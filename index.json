So much fun.\nPhoto credit: Thomas Willmott on unsplash.\nDeeper Down the Rabbit Hole As I worked on site content and structure, I switched to this theme for its design and overall quality. Reading the theme\u0026rsquo;s documentation gave me some additional lessons in the way Hugo creates the static output (Hugo\u0026rsquo;s lookup order). The relatively painless switch in themes gave me a greater appreciation for Hugo\u0026rsquo;s design. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s simple, precise behaviors allowed me to more comfortably predict the effects of my actions. The lookup order can be found in Hugo\u0026rsquo;s official documentation.\nComments with Hyvor Talk - Static Man next! I\u0026rsquo;ve been using HyvorTalk for comments and reactions, as it was something I used in other projects. The documentation for hugo-future-imperfect-slim had a paragraph on staticman, an open-source comment solution for static sites. I hope to test the feature soon, as it looks quite promising. The sample site has a few posts that you can check to see how the staticman comment solutions looks on a page. It is quite beautiful. Do you use Staticman? Let me know in the comments. Maybe I can learn from you! Cheers.\n","ref":"/blog/two/"},{"title":"A Learning Adventure via Github + Hugo","date":"","description":"","body":"Wonderful Github Somtimes I wish I could just learn by osmosis. With Github, I found the next best thing.\nPhoto credit: Dmitry Ratushny on unsplash\nDown the Rabbit Hole I recently figured out how to use Github pages to host a Hugo-created blog site (got interested because of this. As I was learning the method, I got hooked on the beauty of Github. After tinkering and understanding Github a little bit more, I have fallen in love with it.\nIncremental Learning Github\u0026rsquo;s knowledge management features are a wonderful support to the incremental, learning-by-doing style I naturally gravitate to. This blog is one such learning project, and I hope to conduct many experiments here and in other places. Check back soon for more content. If you are doing something similar, let me know in the comments below. Cheers!\nUpdate - had issues with subdomain - fixed I forgot that I commented out/deactivated the line in the yml file that specified my subdomain, which resulted in the constant removing of the subdomain from the pages configuration during updates to the public repository. That has now been fixed. Yay. And, lesson learned.\n","ref":"/blog/one/"}]
